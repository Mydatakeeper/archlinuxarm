# ArchlinuxARM unofficial docker images

The goal of this repository is to provide ArchlinuxARM docker images for *every* available platform.

It is based on [QEMU builds](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/) and the latest [ArchlinuxARM builds](https://archlinuxarm.org/about/downloads)

To use them, simple run `docker run -it mydatakeeper/archlinuxarm:aarch64` with the approriate targeted architecture.
